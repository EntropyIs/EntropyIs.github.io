											<h3>The Forming of the Empire</h3>
											<blockquote>
												<p>
													After many hundreds of years, of brutal wars takeing place on planet Earth, 13 of the surviving regions,
													that used to be known as contries, banded together to form a feirce military force that was succesful in conquering
													the planet and bringing forth more than 100 years of peace, forming what is now only known as "The Empire", lead by
													the decendents of those who once ruled the 13 contries that came before, the Councel of 13.
												</p>
												<p>
													During this time of peace, a fantical loyalty became the norm towards the Councel of 13, and mankind, working together
													finally made their way to the starts, first colonizing the moon, then Mars, and thanks to advancements in technology Vessles
													were made that allowed mankind to finally make their way to the next nearest star, Proxima Centauri.
												</p>
												<p>
													After first ariving at Proxmia Centauri in 2819, it was discorved that there was a planet in the "Goldilocks Zone".
													However the technology avalible ment that space travel was slow, and it takes years for messages to return back to Earth.

											<h3>The Missing Colony Ship</h3>
											<blockquote>
												<p>
													Deemed habitable by the Empire's Science devision, a plan was hatched to construct a Colony Ship with adiquate technology
													to reach the planet, now named Kepler V, in as little as 17 years, and during its journy a fleet of vessles would be 
													constructed to follow the first colony, hopefully at an even greater speed.
												</p>
												<p>
													However, what the Science Devision didnt know that the planet was alredy inhabited, and on the vessles arrival, only escorted
													by a handful of Fighters and Frigates, a not-so-friendly threat was awaiting them in orbit, a balle ensured and the Colony Ship was destroyed.
												</p>
												<p>
													Narrowly escaping this threat, a single frigate, and two fighters managed to send out a message, and on recieving the message, an armarda was formed,
													and full scale invasion was planned.
